Our software is designed to solve a problem of route optimization by passing through target
 points with the presence of obstacles, we took the case of a client who wants to get all the
 products on his list and leave in a optimal route.
 The supermarket offers its client the possibility to choose the products he needs through a
 web interface and an optimal path will be calculated for him. This problem is a variant of the
 travelling salesman problem, we solved it in two different ways, we used operational research
 tools through Google OR libraries in python for the first solver, and Q-learning algorithm for
 the second. Since our algorithms are implemented in python we used django framework to build
 the web interface for the user.
